# Movie Scene Segmentation Prediction

## The model will the predict the scene segmentation. 

### To execute the code

Download the repo and copy the data file into the project directory and name the folder as 'data'.  

### Project Structure

```bash
    |--data
    |    |--all the data file (.pkl)
    |--main.py
    |--evaluate.py
    |--results
        |--all the results (.pkl)
    
```

Then for executing the model type the following command in terminal:

```
python main.py
```

Once the code finished executing, the model is trained and the predicted results are stored in results folder as 'imdb_id.pkl' files.
###### Note: This might take few minutes to finish executing (20-30 mins) Since the data very large to process.

Already trained and predicted results are stored in results folder. To evaluate the model run the following command:

```
python evaluate.py results
```

This will give the evaluation results for model. 

This is output of ``` python evaluate.py results``` : 
```
